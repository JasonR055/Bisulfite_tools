* Make (cluster?) script(s) for bisulfite mapping of reads using bismark
    * Input == fastq(s), Output == bam
    * For hg18 + hg19
    * Single and paired end
    * At some point think about
        * Adaptor trimming
        * Quality score trimming

* Make script for basecall counts at CpG sites
    * Input == bam, output == tsv.gz + Rdata
    * If possible A/C/G/T/N counts, otherwise just Cs/Ts/coverage
    * For hg18 + hg19

* Make script to calculate sequencing depth/amount
    * Input == bam, output == No of aligned bps printed to screen
    ** calculate_depth.R

* Make script to calculate CpG bias
    * Input == bam, output normalised coverage printed to screen
    * For CpG islands, CpG shores, rest of genome
    * For hg18 + hg19

* (For MiSeq) Make script to (soft?) trim primer regions inside bamfile
    * Input == bam + amplicons csv, output == bam

* (For MiSeq) Make script to align same data with multiple bismark settings
    * Vary no of mismatches/alignment quality cutoffs

* (For MiSeq) Make a lane (pre-alignment) report
    * No of reads in each barcode & phiX
    * Min/Average/Max length of reads
